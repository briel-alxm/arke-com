# ARKE | Intake — Operational UI Kit

The case-qualification system. Public intake form + staff queue dashboard + confirmation flow.

## Screens (interactive click-through)

1. **Intake** (`/intake`) — public form, vellum surface, mock case submission
2. **Confirmation** (`/confirmation`) — post-submit state with next-steps card
3. **Queue** (`/queue`) — staff dashboard, obsidian surface, sortable signal-scored cases
4. **Case Detail** (`/queue/:id`) — single case with full scoring breakdown

## Components

- `IntakeHeader.jsx` — branded header (diamond mark · ARKE wordmark · back link)
- `IntakeForm.jsx` — multi-section structured form (contact / case / urgency)
- `Confirmation.jsx` — checkmark card + next-steps list
- `QueueShell.jsx` — staff-portal layout (obsidian sidebar + content)
- `CaseRow.jsx` — single case row with signal score, urgency, status
- `CaseDetail.jsx` — case detail with scoring breakdown
- `StatusBadge.jsx` / `SignalScore.jsx` — operational primitives

## What this kit copies from source

The source repo at `briel-alxm/arke-deploy` uses a warm/cool palette (`#B45F3C` + `#1E293B`) and embeds an Airtable form on the intake page. This kit **lifts the structure and language exactly**, swaps the palette to Briel_style v1, and **mocks the form/queue interactively** instead of embedding Airtable.

The queue dashboard is **new** — the source repo only stubs out links to Airtable, so we render a doctrinal version of what an operator would actually see.
